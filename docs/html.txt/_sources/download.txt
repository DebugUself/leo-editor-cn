Downloading Leo
###############

We recommend using `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ to download Leo. Using git gives you the latest, thoroughly tested code. With git, you can review all the new features and update when you decide. Git also makes it easy to revert to previous versions when problems arise.

- To install using git, follow the instructions at `Installing Leo with git <http://leoeditor.com/installing.html#installing-leo-with-git>`_.

- If you prefer a new development version, or a version from from 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 or 90 days ago, download a `Nightly snapshot <http://leoeditor.com/download.html#snapshots>`_.

- If you want a stable release download from `SourceForge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/files/Leo/>`_. Remember that it *won't* have the latest features and bug fixes.

Snapshots
+++++++++

.zip snapshots can be downloaded directly from `GitHub <https://github.com/leo-editor>`_. No account is required.  The downloaded file will have a name like::

  leo-editor-50c070b715b9fec50c31be5853055a0ebc72cad5.zip

where the ``50c0...cad5`` part is the ID or fingerprint of the version you've downloaded.  Except "Latest", which is just ``leo-editor-master.zip``.
