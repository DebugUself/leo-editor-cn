Downloading Leo
###############

There are four ways to download Leo:

- **New**: Leo 5.7 final will have a `Python wheel`_, so ``pip install leo`` will automatically download *and* install Leo, including all Leo's dependencies. See `Installing Leo with pip`_.

- We recommend installing Leo using `git`_, see `Installing Leo with git`_. Git gives you the latest, thoroughly tested code. All of Leo's developers use git.

- If you prefer a new development version, or a version from from 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 or 90 days ago, download a `Nightly snapshot`_.

- If you want a stable release download from `SourceForge`_. Remember that it *won't* have the latest features and bug fixes.

Snapshots
+++++++++

.zip snapshots can be downloaded directly from `GitHub <https://github.com/leo-editor>`_. No account is required.  The downloaded file will have a name like::

  leo-editor-50c070b715b9fec50c31be5853055a0ebc72cad5.zip

where the ``50c0...cad5`` part is the ID or fingerprint of the version you've downloaded.  Except "Latest", which is just ``leo-editor-master.zip``.
